# Patterns of Lexical Storage and Processing
This repository contains the dataset put up for the study titled "What Word-Guessing Reveals About Your Brain: Patterns of Lexical Storage and Processing" 

**Description of the Variables**

Variable Name | Type | Description | Values / Format
Target word | String | The stimulus word that participants tried to guess based on clues. | Unique word tokens
Concreteness | Categorical | Indicates whether the target word is abstract or concrete in nature. | Concrete, Abstract
POS | Categorical | Part of speech of the target word. | Noun, Adjective, Verb
Frequency | Numeric | Corpus-based word frequency (from Ruscorpora). Higher frequency indicates more common usage. | Integer value
Strategy | Categorical | Type of the clue used by participants to describe the target word. | Antonym, Synonym, Co-hyponym, Hyponym, Hypernym, Collocation, Definition, Real-life example
Trial number | Ordinal | Whether the word was guessed correctly on the first or a subsequent attempt. | 1st Trial, 2nd+ Trial
Guessing outcome | Binary | Outcome of the guessing task. | Yes, No
